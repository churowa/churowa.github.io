It's been a while since I wrote a blog post for myself. I've been meaning to get back into writing for a while, but things always seem to get in the way. 

These days, it's rather straightforward to put up a blog. For this phase, I've elected to go with a static site generated by Jekyll, and served up by Github Pages.

I hope to be able provide some useful content, and hopefully help other people avoid some of the pitfalls I've had!
